        "  - Python is a High-level Programming Language in Computer , it is very popular because it's provide a large number of libraries and it is easy to use , it has strong Community support.\n",

        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - Interpreter in python can read and executes the code line by line , if the error is occured at any line it will stop at that line and below code was not execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined Keywords in Python are reserved keywords that have some special meaning in python.\n",
        "  We cant use pre-defined keywords as a Variable names , Function ,Class Name.\n",
        "  - Examples of Pre-defined keywords in python:\n",
        "    int , float , string , boolean , True , False , None , Class , def ,\n",
        "    if , elif , else , for , break ,continue , pass\n",

        "  - NO , We can't use keywords as variable name.\n",
        "  if we try to use it will give error called synatxError or invalid synatx.\n",
        "---\n",
        "5.   What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python meanes object's value can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "    mutable object - we can change a specific value after the object is created .\n",
        "\n",
        "    immutable object - we can't change a it after the object is created.\n",
        "---\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "  - 1. Lists are mutable means we can add , remove or change the items in a list after it's created.\n",
        "  - 2. Tuples are immutable because we can't add , remove or cahnge the items in a tuple after it's cretaed.\n",
        "  - 3.  list are slow and need a more space tuples are faster and need a less space.\n",
        "---\n",
        "7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "  - 1. \"==\" it is used for cheking if the two vales are equal.\n",
        "  - 2. \"is\" it is use for checking if two varibles are point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "---\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators help to make decisions. They check if things are True or False.\n",
        "  - There are 3 logical operators in python \"and\", \"or\", \"not\".\n",
        "  - \"and\" will return true if both the conditions are true.\n",
        "  - \"or\" will return ture if at least one condition is true\n",
        "  - \"not\" it will reverses the conditions\n",
        "---\n",
        "9.  What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "  - Type casting in python means change one type of data into another type\n",
        "  example -\n",
        "    x = \"12\",\n",
        "    y = int(x)\n",
        "---\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting.\n",
        "  - implicit type casting means python will does it automaticatically by itself.\n",
        "  ex - x = 1.5\n",
        "       y = 5\n",
        "       a = x + y  # 6.5\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Explicit type casting means the user / developer can tell the to change the type by using function like int() , float() , or str()\n",
        "  ex - x = \"13\"\n",
        "       y = int(x) #13\n",
        "---\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - conditional statements in Python is help to make a decisions.\n",
        "  - if the condition is true only that block of code is excute\n",
        "  - it will choose what should do based on certain conditions.\n",
        "---\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "  - elif means else if.\n",
        "  - it is used when we want to check more than one conditions.\n",
        "  - python 1st check if statement if 1st condition is not satified then it will go to next condition or elif statement.\n",
        "  - ex:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  score = 85\n",
        "  if score >= 90:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade A\")\n",

        "  else:\n",
        "    print(\"Fail\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 1st check if-> score >= 90 , not , so it will skip and to next\n",
        "  - then it will goes to 1st elif score >= 80 , yes , so it will print \"Grade B\" and stop checking after finding the match condition.\n",
        "---\n",
        "13. what is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "  - Both the loops aare use to repeate the code - but it used in different conditions.\n",
        "  - \"for\" loop is used when we know how many times to repeat\n",
        "  - \"while\" loop is used when we don't know how many times to repeat\n",
        "---\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "  - For example we can play a game in which we can guess the number. we don't know how many guesses we required to guess a correct number maybe 1 , maybe 15\n",
        "\n",
        "  - so in this type of problem we can use while loop , because we want keep guess number until correct number is guessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ex:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "number = 6\n",
        "guess = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "while guess!=number:\n",
        "  guess = int(input(\"Guess the Number\"))\n",
        "  print(\"Wrong Number ! Try again.\")\n",
        "print(\"You Guessed right number\")\n",
